Digital marketeer turned into frontend developer with experience in Javascript and React.

I am self-motivated, a fast and keen learner and I believe in staying curious, and inquisitive about technology.

I am looking for suitable, frontend roles to apply my skills and abilities in an open, inclusive, and diverse work environment, whether in-person or remotely.
